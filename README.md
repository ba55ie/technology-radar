## What's a Technology Radar?

Each insight we share is represented by a blip. Blips may be new to the latest Radar volume, or they can move rings as our recommendation has changed.

The rings are:

- **Adopt**. Blips that we think you should seriously consider using.
- **Trial**. Things we think are ready for use, but not as completely proven as those in the Adopt ring.
- **Assess**. Things to look at closely, but not necessarily trial yet — unless you think they would be a particularly good fit for you.
- **Hold**. Proceed with caution.
